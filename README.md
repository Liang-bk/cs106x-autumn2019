# cs106x-autumn2019

My solution to cs106x-autumn2019-assignments, the official website of cs106x is [cs106X](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/).

I strongly recommend participants to write the assign1 and assign7 by yourself, both of them give you a large freedom to design the code skeleton and that will improve your ability about decomposing a problem.

I test most of the codes by the "res" directory which is the official test file, but there might still have some bugs in codes that I didn't find when I finish the codes. You can refer to this repository and find a better way to do the job. Hope this repository will help you.

I don't have too much time. So I decide to skip the final project.(ü§ê~~Definitely not because that I don't want to write the GUI myself.~~)
